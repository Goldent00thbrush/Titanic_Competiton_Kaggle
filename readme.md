# The Titanic Competition
## Did they sink or swim?
This is my first Kaggle notebook and submission; I am excited! 
### The problem
This dataset contains info about boarders of the titanic ship. Our goal is to use this data to find trends which determine whether people survived the disaster.
### My assumptions
From the first look at the data, it seems as though factors such as Age, Class and Gender play a pivitol role in determining survival.
